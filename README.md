This GitHub page is the home of DyonDescender; the simple field relaxation code described in [2505.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.XXXXX) capable of minimizing the action associated with dyon field configurations in the $SU(2)$ Georgi-Glashow model.

![RingFlux](/PaperPlots/source_dynamics_plot.png "An example of astrometric lensing. A gravitional lens (purple) approaches a source freely propagating across the sky (red). If the lens is in the foreground relative to the faraway observer, the lens will deflect the apparent path of the star (black).")
